"""
On a classical computer, in a classical language of your choice (such as Java, C, Python, etc), program solutions
to Simon's problem and to Grover's problem.  In each case, treat the input function f as black box that you can call
(but cannot inspect in any way at all).  Each solution will be code that includes one or more calls of f.

Submit two files, one for each problem.  Write detailed comments in the code about why it works.
