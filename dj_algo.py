"""
On a classical computer, in a classical language of your choice (such as C, Java, Python, etc), program solutions
to the Deutsch-Jozsa problem and to the Bernstein-Vazirani problem.  In each case, treat the input function f as
black box that you can call but cannot inspect in any way at all.  Each solution will be code that includes one or
more calls of f.

Submit two files, one for each problem.  Write detailed comments in the code about why it works.
